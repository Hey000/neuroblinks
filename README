Instructions

1. Make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- Requires Matlab v 2010b or later with the Image Acquisition and Image Processing toolboxes.
- Requires a video camera supported by the Image Acquisition toolbox, for instance the Allied Vision Technologies Prosilica GE680.
- Arduino microprocessor or Tucker Davis Technologies RZ5 Bioamplifier (required to use neurophysiology features).

2. Download or clone "neuroblinks" project to your computer and add the main directory of the project to your Matlab path.

3. Modify "Arduino\config.m" or "TDT\config.m" to match your particular configuration (see comments within the m-files).

4. Modify "neuroblinks.m" to call the right "Launch" m-file based on whether you're using Arduino or TDT.

5. Create a session directory, e.g.
    <data root>\<animalID>\<sessionID>

    and make this your current directory in Matlab.

6. Run "neuroblinks.m" to start the main program.
